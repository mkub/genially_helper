# Genially Helpers

This is a simple library of helper functions in JS to manipulate objects on web pages generated by Genially. 

Objects on which the helpers can operate have to be grouped together with the following code ''inserted'':
```
<div id="some unique id"></div>
<script></script>
```
Grouped objects can be then identified by these unique ids, called here ''labels''.

`hide_by_label(label)` -- hides an object containing a given label. 

`hide_on_overlap(label1, label2, hide)` -- hides object containing label `hide` when the objects containing labels `label1` and `label2` mostly overlap.

`show_on_overlap(label1, label2, hide)` -- shows object containing label `hide` when the objects containing labels `label1` and `label2` mostly overlap.

`show_when_all_hidden(label1, labels)` -- shows the object containing label `label1` when all the objects identified by the array of labels `labels` are hidden.
